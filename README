# neuronsim

A small conductance based neuron simulator. About as barebones as they come. Mostly a project for my own practice/education. Built to reinforce some biophysical concepts. I've provided a script in the 'animate.py' file that plots the voltage changing over time, which is kind of neat to watch.

Expansion options include adding fancier conductances (Calcium for instance) and the ability to chain several neurons together.
